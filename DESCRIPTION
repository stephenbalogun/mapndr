Description: The package aims to simplify geospatial analysis and plotting of population pyramids of summary data from the 
    Nigeria National Data Repository (NDR). It aligns with the naming convention for `state`, `LGA` and `sex` variables as 
    obtained from most of the line-lists obtained from the NDR.
